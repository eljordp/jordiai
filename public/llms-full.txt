## Background

I'm Jordan Lopez — most people know me as JDLO. I'm an AI Engineer based in San Francisco, the heart of Silicon Valley where tech innovation thrives. I started from nothing, selling websites for a few hundred dollars. Now I build AI-powered systems, run automated sales teams, and work with companies doing billions in revenue.

I build AI agents, automate workflows, and integrate AI into real business operations. From stunning websites to custom software solutions, I help businesses establish their digital footprint. I also design sales systems, build content strategies, and develop AI-powered automations that streamline workflows and boost productivity.

This isn't from someone who read about AI — this is from someone who runs on it every day.

Being in San Francisco puts me right at the epicenter of technological innovation. It's an environment that constantly pushes me to stay ahead of the curve and explore new possibilities in AI and software development.

When I'm not engineering AI solutions or building software, I'm teaching what I've learned — from AI automation and sales systems to prompt engineering and content strategy. I also mentor a limited group of people who are serious about execution.
